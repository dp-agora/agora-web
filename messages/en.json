It is legal and encouraged by tax codes that intentionally include incentives and allowable deductions. Tax evasion, by contrast, involves deliberately misrepresenting or concealing information to reduce tax liabilities—which is illegal and subject to criminal penalties. All of our advisory work falls strictly within the bounds of legitimate tax planning."

We then design transfer pricing policies that reflect arm's length principles, prepare contemporaneous documentation meeting local and OECD requirements, and conduct benchmarking studies using reliable comparable data.

                "question": "How do you balance tax efficiency with regulatory risk?",
                "answer": "We adhere to a pragmatic optimization philosophy. This means we pursue legitimate efficiencies—treaty benefits, available incentives, thoughtful structuring—while ensuring that every position we recommend can be defended before a tax authority. We avoid aggressive positions that rely on enforcement gaps, and we always model the downside risk of any position being challenged."
